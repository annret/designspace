# Design Space

This project was carried out as part of the Master Thesis "Design Patterns: Development of a Design Space for Mobile Applications to Support Designers" by Anna Rettenbacher at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria.

## Initial Development

The multidimensional logic was initialy developed for the IVES Project (https://ives.kwmhgb.at/#) by Lisa Freller, which was further described in this paper:

Keck, M., Freller, L.-M., Neumayr, T., & Augstein, M. (2024). Uncovering Patterns in Design Spaces: An Exploration Tool for the Analysis of Faceted Interface Collections. https://doi.org/10.1145/3656650.3656729 

Only the files that are relevant for the design space project have been changed and/or adapted.
